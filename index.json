[{"content":"Sequences   Let $a_n$ be a sequence over $R$ that converges to $L$. Is any subsequence of $a_n$ also convergent to $L$?\n  Let $a_n$ be a sequence over $R$ that converges to $L$. It is true that, for any other $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $|a_n - L| \u0026lt; |a_n - M|$, if $n$ is sufficiently large?\n  Let $x_n \\geq 0.$ If $\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow x$. Show that $\\left(\\sqrt{x_{n}}\\right) \\rightarrow \\sqrt{x}$.\n  Squeeze Theorem: Show that if $x_{n} \\leq y_{n} \\leq z_{n}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbf{N}$, and if $\\lim x_{n}=\\lim z_{n}=l$, then $\\lim y_{n}=l$ as well.\n  When can we say that a monotone function is necessarily convergent? Prove it!\n  Limits   What are the most important theorems about limits of functions of a single variable?\n  Enunciate and prove the algebraic properties of limits of functions of a single variable.\n  Evaluate the following limits: $$ \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 4} \\frac{4-x}{2-\\sqrt{x}} \\text { and } \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} x \\sin \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) . $$\n The first limit is solved by noticing that $4-x = (2-\\sqrt{x})(2+\\sqrt{x})$ and that since $x \\neq 4$ (which is always the case when considering a limit tending to $4$​​), we can effectuate the division being considered. The second follows nicely from the fact that even though $1/x \\rightarrow \\infty$ when $x \\rightarrow 0$, the function $\\sin$ is limited by 1.     Continuity 1. What intuitive notions is the definition of continuity trying to capture?\n If the function $f$ is continuous at $a$, it should have the property that points close to $a$ are delivered by $f$ to points closed to $f(a)$. If we mean continuity on a given interval, we would like to function to not have dramatic jumps, that is, that a small enough movement from away from a point $x$ should result into a small movement away from $f(x).$  2. What are the most important theorems about continuity of functions of a single variable?\n Equivalence between the sequential and the epsilon-delta definitions of continuity. The Annulation Theorem. The Intermediary Value Theorem. The Weierstrass Extreme Value Theorem.  3. Assume $f$ and $g$ are defined on all of $\\mathbf{R}$ and that $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow p} f(x)=q$ and $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow q} g(x)=r$. What condition is necessary to say that $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow p} g(f(x))=r$?\n The function $g$ has to be continuous at $q$, since it is possible that $f(x)=q$ for some $x$ close to $p$.  4. Let $f$ be a real single variable function. Prove that if $f$ is continuous at $a$ and $f(a)\u0026gt;0$, then there exists a $\\delta\u0026gt;0$ such that $f(x)\u0026gt;0$ for any $x \\in (a-\\delta, a+\\delta)$.\n Since $f$ is continuous at $a$, take $\\varepsilon$ as equal to $x$. In that way, there must be an $\\delta$ such that every $x \\in (a-\\delta, a+\\delta)$ has to be greater than zero.  Derivatives 1. Prove that if $f$ is differentiable at a given point, then it must be also continuous at the same point.\n  It follows from the algebraic properties of limits.\n  Since $f$ is differentiable at a point $p$, we know that the following limit exists. $$ \\lim_{x \\to p} \\frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p}. $$ It is evident that $\\lim_{x \\to p}x-p$ also exists, therefore, the its product with the limit above must also exist. Lastly, we only need to add a constant value to $\\lim_{x \\to p}f(x)-f(p)$ to conclude that $\\lim_{x \\to p}f(x)$​ must also exist.\n  2. Prove the algebraic properties of differentiability.\n The properties of sum of two functions and of sum of a function and a constant value follow trivially from the algebraic properties of limits. Multiplication and division, however, are achieved by helping ourselves with a handful of analytical subterfuge: the first, by summing zero to the upper part of the limit from the definition of derivatives; the second, by first dealing with the derivative of $1/f(x)$ using the observation that $f(x) (1/f(x))=1.$  3. Prove the Chain Rule.\n Multiplying by $1$ changes nothing. Wink. To-do.  4. Define what is a critical point of a function $f$. Give an example of a function for which has a critical point that is neither a maximum nor a minimum of the said function.\n The critical points of a function are the points for which the derivative of the function at that point is zero. The function $f(x)=x^3$ has $0$ as a critical point, since the derivative of $x^3$ at $0$ is equal to $0$, but the function has neither maximum nor minimum points in all its domain.  5. What points should be considered to find the maximum and minimum values of $f$ on a given interval?\n First, the critical points of the said interval. Second, the points for which the derivative is not defined. Third, the end points of the given interval.  6. If $f'(x) = 0$, for all $x$, must $f$ be a constant function?\n Follows from the Mean Value Theorem.

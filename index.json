[{"content":"Wherein I provide a ridiculously easy to set up approach to write LaTeX as fast as your heart\u0026rsquo;s desire.\nObjective: To be able to write LaTeX symbols as fast as you can type.\nTime required to set up: 5 minutes besides the time required to read the article.\nYears ago I was part of a group of students who were responsible for writing solutions for the local Mathematical Olympiad practicing problems. Every single week I cursed my destiny writing every single character for every single LaTeX expression for every single function, integral, matrix, etc. Worst, in the myriad of symbols, backslashes, and dollar signs, it was easy to make silly mistakes that would inevitably come to hunt me in the near future. There must be a better way.\nI had two main problems:\nProblem 1. Typing LaTeX commands for math symbols takes too much time.\nProblem 2. Seeing the code instead of the actual symbols can disturb the austere mathematical mind.\nAfter a couple of months of complaining, I managed to find a solution for both problems using Emacs and a bunch of mods. I could now write mathematical theorems as fast as someone could talk. The thing is that I possibly spend more time tinkering my Emacs than I would be writing normal LaTeX for a month. While Emacs is one of the most famous and customizable text editors out there, and maybe for the power user this is still the best way to go, I would never be able to put \u0026ldquo;lightning speed setup\u0026rdquo; and Emacs on the same phrase unironically. Besides, most of you are probably using Windows, and installing Emacs and its friends on Windows can be extra troublesome. Fortunately for you, in the last year I\u0026rsquo;ve been using some more friendly options that, although not as sophisticated as my heavily modded and finely tuned Emacs, get the job done and done fast.\nProblem 1. AutoHotKey is your new best friend AutoHotKEy is a macro bla bla bal.\nBefore I explain further, let\u0026rsquo;s first convince ourselves (in case we still have any doubt) that writing LaTeX character by character is no way to live the examined life. Suppose I want to write for you about the epsilon-and-delta definition of Limits. This is what the LaTeX code would look like.\n\\[ \\lim _{x \\rightarrow x_0} f(x)=L \\iff \\forall \\varepsilon \u0026gt; 0 , \\exists \\delta \u0026gt;0: \\\\ 0\u0026lt;\\left|x-x_{0}\\right|\u0026lt;\\delta \\Longrightarrow|f(x)-L|\u0026lt;\\varepsilon \\] Eventually all this code would turn to just this:\n$\\lim {x \\rightarrow x_0} f(x)=L \\iff \\forall \\varepsilon \u0026gt; 0 , \\exists \\delta \u0026gt;0:$ $0\u0026lt;\\left|x-x{0}\\right|\u0026lt;\\delta \\Longrightarrow|f(x)-L|\u0026lt;\\varepsilon.$\nToo many characters to represent just a few symbols.\n","permalink":"https://adrianvalentim.github.io/post/lightning-speed-latex/","summary":"Wherein I provide a ridiculously easy to set up approach to write LaTeX as fast as your heart\u0026rsquo;s desire.\nObjective: To be able to write LaTeX symbols as fast as you can type.\nTime required to set up: 5 minutes besides the time required to read the article.\nYears ago I was part of a group of students who were responsible for writing solutions for the local Mathematical Olympiad practicing problems.","title":"The Lightning Speed Setup for Lightning Speed LaTeX"},{"content":"Sequences   Let $a_n$ be a sequence over $R$ that converges to $L$. Is any subsequence of $a_n$ also convergent to $L$?\n  Let $a_n$ be a sequence over $R$ that converges to $L$.

Prove it!\n  Limits   What are the most important theorems about limits of functions of a single variable?\n  Enunciate and prove the algebraic properties of limits of functions of a single variable.\n  Evaluate the following limits: $$ \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 4} \\frac{4-x}{2-\\sqrt{x}} \\text { and } \\lim _{x \\rightarrow 0} x \\sin \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) . $$\n The first limit is solved by noticing that $4-x = (2-\\sqrt{x})(2+\\sqrt{x})$ and that since $x \\neq 4$ (which is always the case when considering a limit tending to $4$​​), we can effectuate the division being considered. The second follows nicely from the fact that even though $1/x \\rightarrow \\infty$ when $x \\rightarrow 0$, the function $\\sin$ is limited by 1.     Continuity 1. What intuitive notions is the definition of continuity trying to capture?\n If the function $f$ is continuous at $a$, it should have the property that points close to $a$ are delivered by $f$ to points closed to $f(a)$. If we mean continuity on a given interval, we would like to function to not have dramatic jumps, that is, that a small enough movement from away from a point $x$ should result into a small movement away from $f(x).$  2. What are the most important theorems about continuity of functions of a single variable?\n Equivalence between the sequential and the epsilon-delta definitions of continuity. The Annulation Theorem. The Intermediary Value Theorem. The Weierstrass Extreme Value Theorem.  3. Assume $f$ and $g$ are defined on all of $\\mathbf{R}$ and that $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow p} f(x)=q$ and $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow q} g(x)=r$. What condition is necessary to say that $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow p} g(f(x))=r$?\n The function $g$ has to be continuous at $q$, since it is possible that $f(x)=q$ for some $x$ close to $p$.  4. Let $f$ be a real single variable function. Prove that if $f$ is continuous at $a$ and $f(a)\u0026gt;0$, then there exists a $\\delta\u0026gt;0$ such that $f(x)\u0026gt;0$ for any $x \\in (a-\\delta, a+\\delta)$.\n Since $f$ is continuous at $a$, take $\\varepsilon$ as equal to $x$. In that way, there must be an $\\delta$ such that every $x \\in (a-\\delta, a+\\delta)$ has to be greater than zero.  Derivatives 1. Prove that if $f$ is differentiable at a given point, then it must be also continuous at the same point.\n  It follows from the algebraic properties of limits.\n  Since $f$ is differentiable at a point $p$, we know that the following limit exists. $$ \\lim_{x \\to p} \\frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p}. $$ It is evident that $\\lim_{x \\to p}x-p$ also exists, therefore, the its product with the limit above must also exist. Lastly, we only need to add a constant value to $\\lim_{x \\to p}f(x)-f(p)$ to conclude that $\\lim_{x \\to p}f(x)$​ must also exist.\n  2. Prove the algebraic properties of differentiability.\n The properties of sum of two functions and of sum of a function and a constant value follow trivially from the algebraic properties of limits. Multiplication and division, however, are achieved by helping ourselves with a handful of analytical subterfuge: the first, by summing zero to the upper part of the limit from the definition of derivatives; the second, by first dealing with the derivative of $1/f(x)$ using the observation that $f(x) (1/f(x))=1.$  3. Prove the Chain Rule.\n Multiplying by $1$ changes nothing. Wink. To-do.  4. Define what is a critical point of a function $f$. Give an example of a function for which has a critical point that is neither a maximum nor a minimum of the said function.\n The critical points of a function are the points for which the derivative of the function at that point is zero. The function $f(x)=x^3$ has $0$ as a critical point, since the derivative of $x^3$ at $0$ is equal to $0$, but the function has neither maximum nor minimum points in all its domain.  5. What points should be considered to find the maximum and minimum values of $f$ on a given interval?\n First, the critical points of the said interval. Second, the points for which the derivative is not defined. Third, the end points of the given interval.  6. If $f'(x) = 0$, for all $x$, must $f$ be a constant function?\n Follows from the Mean Value Theorem.
